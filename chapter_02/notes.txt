JMX in Action - Chapter 02 Notes

JMX Architecture
- Instrumentation Layer - Contains MBeans and their manageable resources
- Agent Layer - Contains the JMX agents used to expose the MBeans
- Distributed Layer - Contains components that enable management applications to communicate with JMX agents

MBeanServer
- The MBeanServer is the heart of the JMX agents.
- It is created using MBeanServerFactory
- These smell like singletons specific to a domain with a unique name
