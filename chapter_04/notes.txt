JMX in Action - Chapter 04 Notes

Common coding rules for all MBeans
1.  MBeans must be concrete Java classes
	- not abstract
	- can be instantiated
2.  MBeans must have a public constructor
	- no other constructor rules
3.  MBeans must implement an MBean interface (one and only one)
	- either its own or the javax.management.DynamicMBean interface
	- naming scheme ClassNameMBean
4.  MBeans must implement the javax.management.NotificationBroadcaster interface in order to send notifications

Standard MBeans
- implement their own interface (not the javax.management.DymanicMBean interface)
- the interface must be in the same padkage as the implementation in order to be a valid MBean
- Constructors can not be inherited
